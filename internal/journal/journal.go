// Package journal opens the behaviour log: one line for each decision the
// program makes, for a bug report to be filed with and for sonda to compare
// between two revisions.
//
// The log is slog's default logger. A package writes to it with slog.Info
// and slog.Error and has nothing passed down to it; off, the default is a
// handler that discards, and a call costs the one check that finds that out.
//
// REVIEW_LOG=1 writes to stderr, and REVIEW_LOG=/some/file to that file,
// for an application launched from the Finder, where there is no terminal
// to write to. Errors alone are written unless REVIEW_LOG_LEVEL=info
// asks for the decisions too. The frame profiler behind REVIEW_TRACE is a
// separate switch: it answers a different question, and its output differs
// on every run.
//
// Two runs of unchanged code are meant to write the same lines, so that what
// differs between two revisions is what the change did. A message therefore
// carries no duration, no absolute path and nothing ordered by scheduling; a
// value that varies and is still worth having goes in a field, where it can
// be ignored. The time each line was written is such a field.
